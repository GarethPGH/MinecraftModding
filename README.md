# MinecraftModding

FirstMod is in branch master. I forgot that default project branch name was changed to main. So to view files chose master branch.
I can't, yet, figure out how to merge them, and remove, or rename the secondary branch to something more suitable.

Anyway. The mod contains an item. It doesn't really do anything yet, with a smily face texture. 
It also has a block that can be placed, mined, added to the inventory.

Next steps is to learn how to alter, or create new mobs (creatures). 
Intent: to change the behavior of the phantom, and create friendly "dragons", or "birds" out of them
May also neuter the creeper, so it explodes uselessly (or turn it into fireworks). 
It is incredibly annoying, more so than any others in the survival version of the game.
May also create a new resourcepack to change the overall imagery of the game
