# MinecraftModding
Used Minecraft Forge to continue Java practice between semesters in college.
<br>
FirstMod folder contains an item, and a block with a smily face texture. 
The block can be mined and added to the inventory
<br>
Next steps is to learn how to alter, or create new mobs (creatures). 
Intent: to change the behavior of the Creeper, so that players can ride it using the SmileItem to placate it, instead of it blowing up on them
May create a new resourcepack to change the overall imagery of the game
<br>
This project is currently side-lined due to college. I may not return to it afterwards, in favor of completing a large project I have been working on for a long time
