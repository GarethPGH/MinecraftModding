# MinecraftModding

FirstMod folder contains an item. It doesn't really do anything yet, with a smily face texture. 
It also has a block that can be placed, mined, added to the inventory, with a similar texture.

Next steps is to learn how to alter, or create new mobs (creatures). 
Intent: to change the behavior of the phantom, and create friendly "dragons", or "birds" out of them
May also neuter the creeper, so it explodes uselessly (or turn it into fireworks). 
It is incredibly annoying, more so than any others in the survival version of the game.
May also create a new resourcepack to change the overall imagery of the game
